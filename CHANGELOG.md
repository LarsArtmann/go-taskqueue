## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Agent pool**: `tq agent-pool` runs a self-managing loop — periodic
  harvest of repos' TODO_LIST.md backlogs into dedup-keyed `agent` tasks,
  worked by a pool of headless crush agents with an enforced verify gate
  (build + tests), clean-tree protection, per-repo pacing and cost caps
- `tq harvest` command: idempotent backlog ingestion (`--dry-run`,
  `--max-per-tick`, `--allow-dirty`)
- `agent` executor (`internal/executor/agent.go`): runs crush headlessly per
  task, process-group kill on timeout, output tails in errors
- Idempotent enqueue via `DedupKey` (partial unique index, legacy-DB
  migration) — repeated harvests never double-enqueue
- CQA bridge (`internal/bridge/cqa`): Code-Quality-Agent scan findings become
  per-file agent fix tasks (`--cqa-url` on `tq agent-pool`)
- PapDashboard bridge (`internal/bridge/papdashboard`): dead-lettered tasks
  raise alerts; rescues resolve them (`--alert-url` on `tq worker`)
